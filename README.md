# Animate SVG Icons with CSS and Javascript

## Why? 
I really love playing on a Playstation. It has been a part of my life since the Playstation 1 came out. When animating the icons I wanted to create a fun animation that really showcased the main 4 icons that are used on a controller. It was fun to try out different GSAP methods and to get a better understanding on how everything works together. 

## How?
* Use CSS `@keyframes` to define animations
* Use `transform` and `transition` properties to animate SVG elements
* Use `animation` property to apply animations to SVG elements
